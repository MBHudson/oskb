oskb - the on-screen keyboard
-----------------------------

I started writing oskb because really good on-screen keyboards for Linux seemed to be missing. I was playing around with embedded Linux boards and small touch screens and found that the lack of a phone/tablet quality keyboard was a limiting factor. Because oskb is written in Python and uses Qt, parts of it can already be used on different operating systems. At the time of writing this, oskb consists of three parts:
